Put cpt files in here that are to be used by various pieces of the library
(and named specifically).

NOTE: This directory should contain only cpt files that are:
  (a) modifications of the standard ones
  (b) hardcoded somewhere else in this library.

In general, cpt files should be taken out of the cpt-city tree.  The CPT_CITY env variable should point to the root.
