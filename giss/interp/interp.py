class Interp:
	"""Superclass for other items in this package.

	Definitions:
		grid1 = GCM grid.  It must be a lat/lon grid, at relatively lower resolution.
			n1lon = Number of grid cells in longitude direction
			n1lat = Number of grid cells in latitude direction
			n1 = # grid cells in grid1 = n1lat * n1lon
		grid2 = ice grid.  It can be any kind of grid or mesh, at higher resolution.
			Assumes a zero-order paramterization (constant values in each grid cell).
			n2 = # grid cells in grid2
		nhc = Number of elevation classes

	Attributes:
		M[n1, n2] (scipy.sparse.coo_matrix):
			The matrix used to interpolate.  In general, regrid from
			grid1 (GCM) to grid2 (ice) using
				v2 = bilinz.transpose() * v1
		mask2[n2] (np.array, dtype=bool):
			True for gridcells in ice grid that have ice.
			NOTE: The sense of this mask is OPPOSITE that used in numpy.ma
